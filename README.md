## About

- 🏢 I am currently a **Teaching Assistant Professor** in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/mathematical-sciences) at the [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://faculty.stevens.edu/hsafarik). My research consists of developing statistical tools for analysing complex dynamic and dependent data, in particular in the context of dimension reduction for multivariate time series. For example, in the context of financial interactions, there is often some latent hierarchy present among a group of factors which leads to dynamic interaction data. I have developed methods to understand the latent structure present in data such as this.
